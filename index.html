    //here I establish the variables/arrays  ... instead of creating seperate variables for wins/losses/etc, 
    //i will create an array called scoreboard. I will follow that up with a LOOP that responds to a user's click

   // var scoreBoard = [
    //   "Wins: ",
      // "Losses: ",
       //Guesses left:",
       //"Guesses so far",
    // ]; NEVERMIND. list each thing as a sperate variable. inside computer guesses and user guesses, create an array. 

     //NOW i set up the click event when the user presses a key. I follow that up with a computer random guess. THEN i do \
     //a if/else statement that is like if userGuess = computerGuess then true, and console log "true", then will need 
     //to create 


        //so, the variables have been created. Now, weset up the script for functions. 


      // guessesSoFar=(userGuess.target.value);



    //,, <--i input this whe //insert onkeyupfunction
   // We log the computer's pick to console to make it easier to troubleshoot
      // console.log("Computer Guess: " + computerGuess);
     //i will need to generate the computer random guesses, AND THEN will need to do read the user's guess
     //I will also set up if/else statements. these will log if the guesses are true or false

    //insert the functions that determins wins/losses/guesses left/and number of guesses
   //will need to creates events click events, computer random letter generator, be able to read user letter, lower case
